Imagine you work for an elevator company. You are tasked with creating a software problem with the goal of estimating the amount of time it takes for an elevator to depart some floor, F1, and arrive in some other floor, F2. You should consider acceleration and deceleration time and distance. You also should allow for variable heights for different floors. You should also assume a maximum speed above which the elevator must not go.
